	<h2>Unit D: Atomic Physics </h2>
<strong>Themes: </strong>Energy and Matter <br>
<strong>Overview: </strong>In this unit, students study the development and modification of models of the structure of matter. <br>
This unit builds on:
<ul>
	<li>• Science 9, Unit E: Space Exploration </li>
	<li>• Physics 20, Unit C: Circular Motion, Work and Energy </li>
	<li>• Physics 30, Unit A: Momentum and Impulse, Unit B: Forces and Fields and Unit C: Electromagnetic Radiation </li>
</ul>
This unit prepares students for further study of the nature of matter in post-secondary studies in physics. Unit D will require approximately 25% of the time allotted for Physics 30. <br>
  <br>
<strong>Focusing Questions: </strong> 
<ul>
	<li>How is the atom organized? </li>
	<li>How can a model of(SI the atom and the nucleus be subjected to experimental tests? </li>
	<li>How does knowledge of the internal structure of the atom lead to the development of applications of energy supply and to the technology of diagnostic imaging? </li>
