<h1>Unit A: Momentum and Impulse </h1>
<strong>Themes: </strong>Change and Systems <br>	
<strong>Overview: </strong>In this unit, Newton’s second law of motion is linked to the concepts of momentum and impulse. <br>
This unit builds on: <br>
<ul>	
	<li>Physics 20, Unit A: Kinematics; Unit B: Dynamics; and Unit C: Circular Motion, Work and Energy</li>
</ul>	
This unit prepares students for further study of mechanics in subsequent units and for post-secondary studies in physics. Unit A will require approximately 15% of the time allotted for Physics 30. <br>
  <br>
<strong>Focusing Questions:  </strong>
<ul>
	<li>What characteristics of an object affect its momentum?  </li>
	<li>How are momentum and impulse related?  </li>
	<li>How does our understanding of concepts relating momentum and impulse influence the design of safety and sporting equipment? </li>
</ul>
<strong>General Outcomes: </strong>There is one major outcome in this unit. <br>
Students will: <br>
<h2>A1. explain how momentum is conserved when objects interact in an isolated system.</h2>
<strong>Key Concepts: </strong>The following concepts are developed in this unit and may also be addressed in other units or in other courses. The intended level and scope of treatment is defined by the learning outcomes. <br>
<ul>
	<li>impulse </li>
	<li>momentum </li>
	<li>Newton’s laws of motion </li>
	<li>elastic collisions </li>
	<li>inelastic collisions </li>	
</ul>	
<strong>Specific Outcomes for Knowledge </strong> <br>
Students will: <br>
<p class="know-hanging">30–A1.1k define momentum as a vector quantity equal to the product of the mass and the velocity of an object </p>
<p class="know-hanging">30–A1.2k explain, quantitatively, the concepts of impulse and change in momentum, using Newton’s laws of motion </p>
<p class="know-hanging">30–A1.3k explain, qualitatively, that momentum is conserved in an isolated system </p>
<p class="know-hanging">30–A1.4k explain, quantitatively, that momentum is conserved in one- and two-dimensional interactions in an isolated system </p>
<p class="know-hanging">30–A1.5k define, compare and contrast elastic and inelastic collisions, using quantitative examples, in terms of conservation of kinetic energy. </p>
  <br>
<strong>Specific Outcomes for Science, Technology and Society (STS) (Science and Technology Emphasis) </strong>
Students will: <br>
<p class="know-hanging">30–A1.1sts explain that technological problems often require multiple solutions that involve different designs, materials and processes and that have both intended and unintended consequences (ST3) [ICT F3–4.1] </p>
<div class="indent">
	<ul>
		<li>investigate the role of impulse and momentum in the design and function of rockets and thrust systems </li>
		<li>assess the roles that conservation laws, the concepts of impulse and inertia and Newton’s laws play in the design and use of injury-prevention devices in vehicles and sports </li>
		<li>describe the limitations of applying the results from studies of isolated systems in solving a practical problem, as occurred with the early design and deployment of airbags. </li>
	</ul>

</div>
Performing and Recording <br>
Students will: <br>
