	<h2>Unit B: Forces and Fields </h2>
	
	<strong>Themes: </strong>Energy and Matter <br>
<strong>Overview: </strong>In this unit, students investigate electric and magnetic forces and fields and their applications in technological devices. <br>
This unit builds on: 
<ul>
	<li>Science 9, Unit D: Electrical Principles and Technologies </li>
	<li>Physics 20, Unit A: Kinematics; Unit B: Dynamics; Unit C: Circular Motion, Work and Energy; and Unit D: Oscillatory Motion and Mechanical Waves </li>
</ul>
  <br>
This unit prepares students for further study of electromagnetic phenomena in subsequent units and for post-secondary studies in physics. Unit B will require approximately 30% of the time allotted for Physics 30. <br>

<strong>Focusing Questions: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>How was the value of the elementary charge determined? </li>
	<li>What is the relationship between electricity and magnetism? </li>
