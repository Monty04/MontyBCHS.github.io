	<h2>Unit C: Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>
<strong>Themes: </strong>Diversity and Matter <br>
<strong>Overview: </strong>In this unit, students study the nature and characteristics of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), using the wave and photon models of light. <br>
This unit builds on:
<div class="indent"> 
	<ul>
		<li>Science 8, Unit C: Light and Optical Systems </li>
		<li>Physics 20, Unit C: Circular Motion, Work and Energy </li>
		<li>Physics 30, Unit A: Momentum and Impulse and Unit B: Forces and Fields </li>
	</ul>
</div>
This unit prepares students for further study of EMR phenomena and the nature of matter in Unit D and for post-secondary studies in physics. Unit C will require approximately 30% of the time allotted for Physics 30. <br>
  <br>	
<strong>Focusing Questions: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>What roles do electricity and magnetism play in EMR? </li>
		<li>Does EMR have a wave or a particle nature? </li>
		<li>What experimental evidence is required to decide whether EMR has a wave or a particle nature? </li>
		<li>What technological devices are used today as a result of investigating and applying electromagnetic phenomena? </li>
	</ul>
<strong>General Outcomes: </strong>There are two major outcomes in this unit. <br>
Students will:
<ol>
	<li>explain the nature and behaviour of EMR, using the wave model </li>
	<li>explain the photoelectric effect, using the quantum model. </li>
</ol>	
<strong>Key Concepts: </strong>The following concepts are developed in this unit and may also be addressed in other units or in other courses. The intended level and scope of treatment is defined by the learning outcomes.
<ul>
	<li>speed of EMR </li>
	<li>propagation of EMR </li>
	<li>reflection </li>
	<li>refraction </li>
	<li>diffraction </li>
	<li>interference </li>
	<li>total internal reflection </li>
	<li>Snell’s law </li>
	<li>photoelectric effect </li>
	<li>Compton effect </li>
</ul>
