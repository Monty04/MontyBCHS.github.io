<h3 class="S10Cc">Equilibrium </h3>
A state of balance between opposing actions. The cell must have an equilibrium between the flow of materials into and out of the cell.  If the flow in is larger the cell will expand and explode.  If the flow out is larger then the cell will deflate and implode.

The cell membrane is referred to as a plasma membrane, consists of a phospholipid bilayer.  This is a double layer of lipids that each have a phosphate group attached.  The phosphates face out into the watery fluids.  The lipids face towards each other in the inner part of the membrane. <br>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Fluid-mosaic model </h3>
The proteins are the framework for the fluid-like lipids. Each part of the membrane has a role to play in allowing the exchange of nutrients, gases and wastes in and out of the cell. <br>

          <h2 class="S10Cbg secTitle">C2.2  The Role of the Cell Membrane in Transport  </h2>
       <h3 class="S10Cc">The Particle Model of Matter </h3>
<ol>
	<li>All matter is made of particles. </li>
	<li>The particles are constantly moving. </li>
	<li>The particles are attracted to one another or are bonded together. </li>
	<li>Particles have spaces between them.  Smaller spaces in solids and larger spaces in gases. </li>
</ol>

<span class="def">Diffusion </span>- Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. <br>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Rate of Diffusion</h3>
The speed at which things diffuse depends on three factors:
<ol>
	<li>The larger the concentration gradient (difference), the faster the diffusion will occur. </li>
    <li>The smaller the molecule the faster it will diffuse. </li>
	<li>The hotter the molecule the more kinetic energy it has, and the faster it moves. </li>
</ol>

<span class="def">Solution </span> - A material dissolved in a liquid. (salt water)
<ul>
	<li><b>Solvent </b> - The substance that dissolves one or more solutes in a solution. (water) </li>
	<li><b>Solute </b>- The material dissolved in the solution. (salt) </li>

</ul>

<span class="def">Concentration gradient </span> - Difference within a given area between the highest and lowest concentration of a particular chemical substance. <br>

" width="500" height="300" alt="concentration gradiant"/> <br>
<h3 class="S10Cc">Passive Transport </h3>
When chemicals diffuse from one area to another.  Requires no energy input by the cell to occur.
Selectively permeable
Allows selected materials to pass through. <br>

<span class="def">Semi-permeable </span>- Allows some materials to pass through.  Extremely small filter. <br>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Osmosis </h3>
The specific case of diffusion of water from one area to another. <br>
When osmosis occurs in cells one of three conditions will exist:
<ul>
	<li><span class="def">Isotonic </span>- When the cell has the same concentration as the solution around it.  The flow into the cell and out of the cell are the same. This is the normal healthy condition for the cell. </li>
	<li><span class="def">Hypertonic </span>- When the solution around the cell has a higher concentration of solutes than the insides of the cell. Water flows out of the cell to dilute the solution.  This dehydrates the cell and the organism feels thirsty. </li>
	<li><span class="def">Hypotonic </span>- When the solution around the cell has a lower concentration of solutes than the insides of the cell. Water flow into the cell to dilute the concentration of solutes.  Causes the cell to expand and over-hydrate and the organism feels the need to urinate. </li>
 </ul>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Facilitated Diffusion </h3>
When the cell helps the materials to diffuse quicker. <br>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Diffusion </h3>
Channel proteins create openings in the cell membrane which allow molecules to diffuse across the cell membrane. <br>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Facilitated diffusion </h3>
Carrier proteins attach to larger molecules and change shape to physically transport the molecules across the cell membrane. <br>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Active Transport </h3>
Movement of molecules or ions across a membrane against a concentration gradient. <br>
Requires energy input from the cell (ATP). <br>
The energy for active transport comes from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  A series of chemical reactions occurs in the mitochondria to produce ATP.<br>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Endocytosis and Exocytosis </h3>
<span class="def">Endocytosis </span>- Intake of particles or molecules by formation of a vesicle (vacuole)from the cell membrane.<br>
<span class="def">Exocytosis </span>- Release of molecules from a vesicle that fuses with the cell membrane to export the molecules from the cell.<br>

          <h2 class="S10Cbg secTitle">C2.3  Applications of Cellular Transport in Industry and Medicine </h2>
	<h3 class="S10Cc">Membrane Technologies </h3>
	Industrial use of synthetics to mimic the action of membranes <br>
	<span class="def">Recognition Proteins </span>- Protein molecules protruding from cells that allow communication between cells. <br>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">Receptor Proteins </h3>
	Specialized molecules on the surface of the cell to which messenger molecules from other cells can bind.
	Especially important for cell to cell communication for immune system responses. <br>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">Membrane Proteins and Disease </h3>
	Many diseases (viruses and bacteria) attach themselves to recognition proteins on the surface of the cells.
	Scientists hope to understand how the diseases attach to the recognition proteins.  By understanding the how diseases attach to the proteins scientists can block the disease preventing its spread. <br>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">Synthetic Membrane Technology </h3>
	Synthetic membranes allow for the filtering of extremely small particles.  Peritoneal dialysis uses semi-permeable membranes to filter wastes out of the blood for people with kidney problems.  Their blood is pumped out of the body, filtered by a membrane and pumped back in. <br>

	 Reverse Osmosis is a method for cleaning water.  Dirty water is forced through a membrane which filters out even the smallest impurities at the atomic level.  It is called reverse osmosis because the water is forced in the opposite direction of normal osmosis diffusion. <br>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">The Size and Shape of Organisms </h3>
	Even though organisms range in size from 25 m long whales to 0.001 m insects, all have groups of cells to perform functions.
	The size of the cells in all organisms is similar to maximize the diffusion of materials throughout the cell.  Cells are generally elliptical or rectangularal prism in shape. <br>
	 <br>
	<h3 class="S10Cc">Maximizing Potential </h3>
	The more surface area per volume the cell has then the more easily the cell can to adapt to changing conditions.  
	This is why even large organisms are made of small cells.<br>

	When the cell runs low on nutrients it slows the synthesis of new materials from the nutrients.  
	When the cell has lots of nutrients is speeds up the synthesis of new materials.
	When the cell runs low on oxygen it slows its rate of respiration.
	When the cell is surrounded by wastes, it slows down and stops making wastes.
	When the cell has lots of oxygen it speeds up its rate of respiration.
	When the cell has lots of energy and nutrients it replicates forming two cells. <br>

	Cancer is a an example of a non homeostatic cell.  Cancer cells grow at an uncontrolled rate and ignore the body’s signals to stop replicating.  This mass of cells will form a tumor.  Cancerous tumors damage surrounding tissue by building up nutrients, generating wastes, and pushing healthy cells out of the way.  <br>
	Sections of tumors can break away and travel through the bloodstream and start new tumors in different locations.  This is why cancer is sometimes very difficult to stop.  Although the metabolic activity of cancer cells ensures the cells survival, the organism cannot maintain homeostasis and dies. <br>
