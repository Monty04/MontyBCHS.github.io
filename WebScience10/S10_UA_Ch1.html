					<h1>Unit A:  Energy and Matter in Chemical Change (Nature of Science Emphasis)</h1>
					<strong>Overview:</strong> Chemical changes involve energy and transformations of matter.  A knowledge of the underlying structure of matter and the basic chemical species is important in understanding chemical changes.  As students explore the properties of molecular and ionic compounds, including acids and bases, they begin to appreciate the need for a classification scheme and a system of nomenclature. Students classify, name compounds and write balanced chemical equations to represent chemical changes.  As well, students are introduced to the law of conservation of mass and the mole concept.

	Wine merchant William Sokolin had paid $30 for a 1787 bottle of  Chateau Margaux once owned by Thomas Jefferson. He presented it before a group of 300 wine collectors at Manhattan's Four Seasons restaurant in 1989, hoping that one of them might offer $519 000 for it.

<h3 class="S10Ac">Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) </h3>
MSDS contain safety and chemical information that is useful for the chemical's users and for first responders and hazardous cleanup teams.  The MSDS must be stored in an easy to access location where ever they are stored.  That includes during transportation.  Some of the information they conatin are:
<ul>
	<li>Protective Clothing symbols </li>
	<li>Chemical Name and formula </li>
	<li>Synonym - other slang or common names or short forms </li>
	<li>Emergency numbers for dealing with large spills </li>
	<li>Emergency procedures for: contact with skin or eyes, ingestion, inhalation etc... </li>
</ul>
The Most Important Safety Feature is YOU!!! <br>
You are responsible for your safety and actions.  Only you can protect yourself from other people's accidents hurting you. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Environmental Safety </h3>
Always dispose of chemicals properly.  Whatever you pour down the drain goes into our waterways.  Most wastewater and water treatment plants are not designed to remove chemicals, so those chemicals will pass into our drinking water system. <br>

In a chemical reaction atoms change what they are bound to.  When carbon burns it chemically reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide.  The single carbon atom reacts with a pair of oxygen atoms that are bound together.  The carbon binds onto the two oxygen atoms to form a three atom molecule. <br>
 <br>
There are some indicators that a chemical reaction occurred:
<ul>
	<li>The substance changed colour. <span class="ex">Ex.</span> <span class="example">Rusting iron changes from a silver colour to red. </span></li>
	<li>The substance changed state. <span class="ex">Ex.</span> <span class="example">Burning wood releases smoke and gases. </span></li>
	<li>Bubbles showed the release of a gas.  <span class="ex">Ex.</span> <span class="example">Sodium in water releases bubbles. </span></li>
	<li>The substance changed temperature.  <span class="ex">Ex.</span> <span class="example">Cold pack gets cold when the chemicals are mixed. </span></li>
	<li>A new substance is formed. <span class="ex">Ex.</span> <span class="example">Nylon plastic is made by mixing two clear colourless liquids. </span></li>

          <h2 class="S10Abg secTitle">A1.3  Developing Ideas about Matter </h2>
	<h3 class="S10Ac">Food Chemistry </h3>
		  <em>Heating and Freezing. </em><br>
Heating sterilizes food products by killing the bacteria that causes food to rot.  Cooking meat kills the bacteria on the surface.  
Hamburger must be thoroughly cooked because bacteria could be on all of the ground surfaces.  Steaks only need to be surface cooked because there is no internal bacteria that is dangerous. 

Lots of restaurant will not serve steak blue rare for safety reasons.  Only eat steak tartar at a good quality restaurant.  DO NOT make your own!

Freezing does not kill bacteria, but it freezes all of the water that the bacteria need to break down the food.  The bacteria simply wait until the food is defrosted.  Food can be preserved for multiple years by freezing. <br>
 <br>
<em>Salting </em><br>
The salt is used to dehydrate the food by putting the food cells in a hypotonic situation.  The bacteria are also dehydrated and killed.  This was used before freezing became practical in the 1900s. <br>
 <br>
<em>Fermentation and Pickling </em><br>
Pickling uses bacteria called lactobacilli to convert sugar into lactic acid that prevents the growth of bacteria that cause food to rot and decay. Fermenting is best known for producing alcohol from sugars. <br>
 <br>
<em>Metallurgy - an Early Branch of Chemistry </em><br>
Early civilizations discovered that they could make tools out of metal deposits found on the ground.  As early as 4000 B.C. copper was the initial metal commonly used.  Copper was used because it is soft and easy to make into tools with just rocks and wood to work with.  As copper technology improved people discovered that mixing copper with  other metals would produce different metal alloys. <br>

Mixing copper with tin produced a metal alloy called bronze which was stronger and more rigid than pure copper.   This led to the bronze age around 2500 B.C.  With stronger and better tools, different cultures experimented with different metals, alloys, mining and refining techniques. <br>

The iron age started around 1200 BC. when smelting processes were developed.  Smelting is heating iron ore (iron mixed with rock) to melt and separate the iron.  Since iron is much stronger than bronze it became a new preferred metal for things like armour and weapons.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Aristotle's Description of Matter </h3>
Around 400 B.C. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, believed that all matter was composed of the four elements: fire, earth, water and air.  <br>
Democritus, another Greek, proposed that matter was made up of tiny particles that could not be divided into smaller pieces.  He called the particles atomos which is Greek for invisible. <br>
 However, the philosophers did not attempt to test their ideas by systematic experimentation.  They preferred to observe nature and derive theories from observations. <br>
 <br>
 <span class="ex">Ex.</span><span class="example">Tree = Fire, Water, EarthDried Wood = Fire, EarthAshes = Earth </span><br>
 <br>
<em>Alchemy </em><br>
With the fall of the Greek and Roman empires, chemistry was carried out by a group called alchemists.  
Alchemy was a combination of science, magic and tricks.  Alchemists are famous for trying to get rich by trying to change lead and other metals into gold.  
Alchemists discovered many important facts and developed better equipment, but did not cooperate so ideas didn't spread.  The same work was repeated over and over by different alchemists.  Towards the 1500s the study of alchemy led to chemistry. <br>
 <br>
<em>Developing Hypotheses about Matter </em><br>
As chemistry was developed into a systematic experimental based science, theories developed about what matter is made of.  Democritus' ideas were the foundation for models of the atom.  
Over time different experiments have some more and more details of the atom, and theories have adjusted accordingly. <br>

Instead a few atoms were deflected. From his experiment he proposed a new model of the atom. This is sometimes called the planetary model (the electrons are like the planets going in circles around the nucleus, the sun).

When electrons gained electrical energy they jumped up shell levels, and then fell down releasing energy in the form of light.  This is the most commonly used model in movies and animations. <br>
