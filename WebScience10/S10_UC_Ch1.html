<h3 class="S10Cc">Early Microscopes and Microscopists </h3>
Microscopes were invented in 1595 by Hans and Zacharias Janssen. It was acompound microscope. Compound meaning more than one lens. <br>
Had the ability to magnify objects by a factor of 20 times.  eg. 1 mm would look like 20 mm through the lens<br>
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek used high quality single lens microscopes with a magnification of 250X. He observed single celled animals: bacteria, sperm and unicellular protozoa, and made detailed diagrams of each. <br> 
 <br>
     
	<h3 class="S10Cc">Improvements in Lens Technology </h3>
Single lens microscopes were initially better than compound (multiple lens) microscopes.  Once higher quality lenses (achromatic) were used in compound microscopes, they became much more powerful than single lens microscopes. <br>
 <br>
	<h3 class="S10Cc">Cell theory </h3>
Robert Brown identified that the dot seen in a cell is the nucleus and is important for cell function. <br>
M.J. Schleiden observed that all plants were composed of cells and the nucleus was in fact the structure that is responsible for the development of the cell.  <br>
Shleiden's  friend Theodor Schwann found the same cell structure made up animal cells and the cells also contained a nucleus. <br>
<br>

          <h2 class="S10Cbg secTitle">C1.2  Development of the Cell Theory </h2>
        <h3 class="S10Cc">Spontaneous generation </h3>
The idea that life could emerge, without external interference, from non-living material. If you put out organic materials, living things would develop from the materials. <br>
 <br>     
<h3 class="S10Cc">Von Helmont's experiments to prove spontaneous generation </h3>
In the early 1600s Von Helmont did an experiment to verify spontaneous generation of life by putting wheat and cloth in a container in a field for a month.  At the end of the month he found mice in the container and concluded that the wheat and cloth had turned into mice through spontaneous generation. <br>
<ul>
	<li>What was the manipulated variable? </li>
	<li>What was the responding variable? </li>
	<li>What was a control variable? </li>
</ul>
 <br>
Von Helmont's second experiment was to plan a willow tree in a pot.  He carefully measured the mass of the dirt and the seed at the start.  He then only added measured amounts of water to the pot for 5 years.  At the end he measured the mass of the dirt (no change) and the mass of the tree (large increase).  Von Helmont concluded that the extra mass of the tree (living) was the water (non-living) being changed into living matter which again supported spontaneous generation. <br>
<ul>
	<li>What was the manipulated variable? </li>
	<li>What was the responding variable? </li>
	<li>What was a control variable? </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Cc">Redi's experiment to disprove spontaneous generation </h3>
In 1668 Francesco Redi challenged the idea that meat would spontaneously change into maggots.  He split a piece of meat in pieces and placed each piece in a different jar.  He put the lids on some jars, cloths over other jars and left the other jars open.  After a period of time he observed that the open jars had maggots going on the meat and concluded that the flies had left the maggots on the meat, because the othe jars had no flies due to the coth or closed jars.  This experiment disproved spontaneous generation because it showed that maggots (life) had to come from flies (life). <br>
<ul>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Needhan experiment to prove spontaneous generation </h3>
In 1745 John Needhan knew that boiling broth would kill all microbes in the broth.  He boiled broth and then sealed the containers. Over time the broth would turn cloudy indicating the presence of microbes.  Needhan concluded that the broth (non-living) and changed into microbes (living). <br>

	<li>What was the manipulated variable? </li>
	<li>What was the responding variable? </li>
	<li>What was a control variable? </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Cc">Spallzani's experiment to disprove spontanteous generation </h3>
Lazzaro Spallzani citicized Needham's experiment by pointing out that microbes from the air could have got into the broth after boiling but before it was sealed. To counter this Spallzani sealed the broth containers and boiled them, killing all microbes in the containers.  The broth did not turn cloudy.  However, he was criticized because the sealed containers would not allow air to get in, and air is necessary for life. <br>
<ul>
	<li>What was the manipulated variable? </li>
	<li>What was the responding variable? </li>
	<li>What was a control variable? </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Cc">Pasteur's experiment to disprove spontaneous generation </h3>
Louis Pasteur modified Spallzani's experiment to allow air in.  He made a containter with a long S shaped neck.  This allowed air in and out of the container but dust and microbes would settle in the curve.  He boiled the broth and it stayed clear.  He could then carefully tip the container so some broth touched the dust in the S neck and then the broth would turn cloudy which should the microbes came from the dust. <br>
This was considered a definitive experiment that showed spontaneous generation was not possible. <br>
<ul>
	<li>What was the manipulated variable? </li>
	<li>What was the responding variable? </li>
	<li>What was a control variable? </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="S10Cc">Cell Theory </h3>
With the improvements in microscopes, in 1833 Robert Brown identified an important cell structure, the nucleus.
Matthias Schleiden was studying plants and Theodor Schwann was studying animals.  Together they found that both animals and plants were made of cells and the cells had nuclei.
	<ol>
		<li>All living things are made up of one or more cells and the materials produced by the cells. </li>
		<li>All life functions take place in cells, making them the smallest unit of life. </li>
		<li>All cells are produced from pre-existing cells through the process of cell division. </li>
