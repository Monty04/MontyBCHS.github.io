					<h1>Unit A:  Energy and Matter in Chemical Change (Nature of Science Emphasis)</h1>
					<strong>Overview:</strong> Chemical changes involve energy and transformations of matter.  A knowledge of the underlying structure of matter and the basic chemical species is important in understanding chemical changes.  As students explore the properties of molecular and ionic compounds, including acids and bases, they begin to appreciate the need for a classification scheme and a system of nomenclature. Students classify, name compounds and write balanced chemical equations to represent chemical changes.  As well, students are introduced to the law of conservation of mass and the mole concept.

	<h3 class="S10Ac">The Elements </h3>
	There are about 90 naturally occurring elements and another 25 synthetic (man-made) elements.  Based on their properties all elements are divided into three classes:  metals, non-metals and metalloids. <br>
	 <br>
	 <img src="S10_UA_Chem_Ch2/PeriodicTableMetalsNonMetals.png" width="768" height="483" alt="Periodic Table"/> <br>
	 <em>Metals </em> <br>
	 <ul>
		<li>conduct heat and electricity easily</li>
		<li>silver/grey or yellow/gold in colour </li>
		<li>shiney </li>
		<li><span class="def">malleable </span>- can be beaten or rolled into sheets without crumbling </li>
		<li><span class="def">ductile </span> - can be stretched into a wire </li>
		<li>solids at room temperature except for mercury which is a liquid </li>
	</ul>
	 <br>
	<em>Non-metals </em><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-conductors - will not allow electrons to move easily</li>
		<li>Only 17 elements </li>
		<li>They are not similar to each other </li>
		<li>Multiple colours </li>
		<li>Reactivity varies </li>
		<li>State varies (solid, liquid or gas)</li>
	</ul>
	 <br>
	<em>Metalloids </em><br>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="ex">Ex.</span><span class="example"> Silicon, boron and arsenic </span></li>
		<li>Semi-conductors - will allow some electrons to flow but are resistive.</li>
		<li>Located between the metals and non-metals </li>
		<li>Properties vary </li>
	</ul>
	 <br>

	<h3 class="S10Ac">The Periodic Table </h3>
	Organizes elements based on their properties.  Metals are on the left, non-metals on the upper right and metalloid are in between. <br>
	<span class="def">Periods </span>- Each horizontal row is called a period. <br>
	<span class="def">Groups </span>- Each vertical column is called a group or family.  Groups tend to behave the same way.
	<ul>
		<li>Group one is called the alkali metals.  They are all soft, shiny, silver coloured and very reactive with water. </li>
		<li>Group two is called the alkaline-earth metals.  They are shiny and silver but not as soft as the alkali metals.  They are less reactive than group one. </li>
		<li> Group 18 is called the noble gases.  They are very non-reactive and gaseous. </li>
		<li>Group 17 is called the halogens.  These elements are poisonous and react readily with the alkali metals to form ionic salts. </li>

	 <h3 class="S10Ac">Atomic Theory </h3>
	The smallest stable particle is called an atom.  Atoms are extremely small, about 10<sup>-10</sup> m across. <br>

	<em>Subatomic Particles </em><br>
	Sub, means small.  Subatomic, means smaller than an atom. <br>
	Atoms are made of three subatomic particles  electrons (negatively charged), protons (positively charged) and neutrons (no charge).  All the protons and neutrons are clustered in the nucleus at the center of the atom.  The nucleus is extremely small but makes up 99.9% of the atom's mass <br>
	 <br>
	<em>Energy Levels </em><br>
		The electrons are grouped in energy levels.  Each energy level is a large distance from the nucleus and makes up 99.9% of the atom's volume.   Electrons are normally found in the energy levels closest to the nucleus. <br>
	 <br>
	<h3 class="S10Ac">Atomic Number </h3>

	<span class="def">Atomic number </span>- number of protons in a atom;  can be used to specify an element.
	Each element has a unique number of protons.  It is the number of protons that dictates what element the atom is. <br>

	<h3 class="S10Ac">Mass Number and Atomic Molar Mass </h3>
	<span class="def">Atomic molar mass </span>- average molar mass of an element's atoms, including those of all the element’s different isotopes. <br>
	<span class="def">Isotopes </span>- atoms of the same element containing different numbers of neutrons. 
	The number of neutrons can be calculated from the isotope's atomic mass and the atomic number. <br>

	<span class="def">Bonding animation </span><br>


<h3 class="S10Ac">Identifying Ionic Compounds </h3>
Always a metal (+) and a non-metal (-) ion <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Properties of Ionic Compounds </h3>
<em>High melting point </em> <br>
Ionic compounds are solids at room temperature because of their high melting points (170 <sup>o</sup>C +) <br>
 <br>
<em>Retention of Crystal Shape </em> <br>
Whatever size of particle is taken, the same distinctive crystal shape will be maintained with flat faces. <br>
 <br>
<em>Solubility in Water </em><br>
<span class="def">Polar </span>- description of an object that has a positive electric charge at one end and a negative charge at the other; water molecules are slightly polar. <br>
Due to the polar nature of water, ionic materials will dissolve in water and the ions will dissociate (separate).  <br>
 <br>
<em>Conductivity in solution </em><br>
<span class="def">Electrolytes </span>- solution that conducts electricity; ionic compounds are excellent electrolytes <br>
 <br> 
Pure water is a non-conductor.  Most tap water has large numbers of ions dissolved in it.  The ions, due to their electrical charge, are very good conductors.  Hence, water with ions in it (salt water, tap water) is a fairly good conductor.  Our body uses electrolytes (gaterade, powerade) to send electrical signals through the nervous system. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Solubility of Ionic Compounds </h3>
Not all ionic compounds dissolve as well as others.  You can dissolve more salt in hot water than cold water.  
A substance that does not dissolve well is called slightly soluble, whereas a substance that does dissolve well is called highly soluble. <br>
Find the table on page 10 of your data booklet. <br>
 <br>
<span class="def">Precipitate </span>- solid with low solubility that forms from a solution. <br>
<span class="def">Precipitation </span>- (in solutions) process of forming a solid from a solution. <br>
 <br>
To remove ions from a solution, you need a substance to form a non-soluble form of the ion you want to remove. The ions will react and form a solid that will settle out or be filtered of the solution. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Properties of Molecular Compounds </h3>
<span class="def">Covalent bonds </span>- bond formed when non-metallic atoms share electrons; atoms in a molecule are bound together by covalent bonds. <br>
Each group of atoms that form a molecule are bound together by very strong covalent bonds.  However, the bonds between each molecule is very weak.  It requires a lot of energy to separate the atoms from each other in a molecule, however, it is relatively simple to remove molecules from each other.  <br>
Molecular compounds have low boiling points and most of the smaller molecules are gaseous at room temperature.  The larger molecules are liquid or solid at room temperature but easily change to a gas. <br>
<br> 
<span class="ex">Ex. </span> 
<div class="example">
	<ul>
    	<li>Methane CH<sub>4</sub> is a gas (natural gas) </li>
		<li>Ethane C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is a gas </li>	
		<li>Propane C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> is a gas (gas bar-b-que) </li>
		<li>Butane C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> is a gas (lighter fuel) </li>
		<li>Hexane C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> is a liquid </li>
		<li>Heptane C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>14</sub>  is a liquid </li>
		<li>Octane C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> is a liquid (gasoline) </li>
    </ul>
	As you can see, the smaller molecules are gases, the medium sized molecules are liquids and the larger molecules form solids (wax) <br>
 </div>
 <br>
<span class="def">Special Properties of Water </span><br>
Water is an unusual molecule because it is a bent shape and the electrons are not quite equally shared (due to hydrogen behaving like a metal).  As a result of the molecular geometry and the unequal distribution of electrons, water has a slightly positively charged side, and a slightly negatively charged side.  
Water behaves like a molecular compound and an ionic compound. <br>
 <br>
Water has a high boiling point compared to molecular compounds but low compared to ionic compounds.  It forms crystals when frozen (six sided snowflakes). See <a href="http://snowcrystals.com">Snow Crystals.com</a> for examples of snowflake photographs. <br>
Due to its unusual properties it is critical to life.  It holds most of the heat energy on the planet's surface.  It allows our body to chemically react with ionic and molecular compounds.  Without water's properties life would never exist on Earth. <br>
 <br>
<em>Formation of Ice </em><br>
As water molecules cool and lose energy, the molecules spread out into a hexagonal formation.  The positive side of one molecule moves closer to the negative side of the adjacent molecule.  Due to this alignment ice is less dense than water so it will float on water.  All other solids sink in their liquid form. <br>

<h3 class="S10Ac">The pH Scale </h3>
<span class="def">Neutral </span>- description of a substance that is neither acidic nor basic; solution with a pH of 7 <br>
The pH scale measures the number of hydrogen and hydronium ions in a solution.  The scale goes from 1 (very acidic) lots of hydrogen ions, up to 7 (neutral) equal number of hydrogen and hydronium ions cancel each other out to water, up to 14 (very basic) lots of hydronium ions.

          <h2 class="S10Abg secTitle">A2.5  Our Chemical Society </h2>
	Our society uses an incredible number of chemicals.  Since the development of synthetic (man made) materials about 100 years ago, the number of chemicals and their uses has expanded enormously.  However, with the great benefits come large consequences. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Issues Related to Chemicals </h3>
Scientists and engineers are responsible for a chemical from “cradle to grave”.  Which means that they must consider all of the hazards from manufacturing, including byproducts, to the use, intended and unintentional, and finally to safe permanent disposal. <br>
 <br>
<em>Environmental Effects </em><br>
Sometimes the environmental effects are overlooked.  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) were developed to be a safe replacement for the propellant gases used in aerosol cans.  They were tested on rats, rabbits, human tissue samples, fish, and plants with absolutely no side effects. <br>
 <br>
However, when CFC drift high up into the atmosphere (50 to 100 km) the high energy UV light causes the chemically stable CFCs to undergo a chemical reaction which releases a chlorine ion. The chlorine ion and UV light cause a further chemical reaction that changes ozone (three atoms of oxygen, O<sub>3</sub>) into diatomic oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). <br>  
Ozone absorbs UV light so that it can not get to the surface of the Earth and cause cancer.  With the hole in the ozone layer more and more UV light gets to the surface and causes skin cancer.
This was a completely unexpected result. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Health Concerns </h3>
Some chemicals have some significant impact on our bodies and health.
Psychological addiction is when a person enjoys the feeling so intensely that they want to have it again.  Psychological addiction tends to be extremely long term, the person may stop but they will forever be tempted to start again. 
 <br>
Illegal drug producers (growers and chemists) have been using chemistry to "improve" the physical and psychological addictiveness of their products. <br>
 <br>
<em>Alcohol </em> <br>
Alcohols are a class of chemical with a carbon chain linked to a hydroxide.  Ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) is the only "safe" one to drink because although poisonous, the body can break it down and you can have a relatively high concentration in you body without suffering permanent effects.  Methanol (methyl alcohol, wood alcohol, CH<sub>3</sub>OH) is a possible product of "home brew/moonshine" or improper brewing conditions.  Even in small quantities (10 mL) of methanol causes permanent blindness and 100 mL is fatal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_toxicity">Wikipedia - Methanol toxicity</a>). Ethanol can cause both physical and psychological addiction. <br>
 <br>
<em>Nicotine </em><br>
Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that is in cigarettes, cigars and chewing tobacco.  Nicotine is only one of many toxic chemical released into the body by tobacco products.  <br>
 <br>
Smokers have higher probability of many dangerous health conditions.  See the following for statistics <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/">CDC Smoking and Tabacco use</a>. <br>
For these reasons, most governments in Canada are slowly reducing the locations that people are able to smoke. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Benzene - A Regulated Substance </h3>
Benzene is a very toxic substance that is classified as a regulated substance, which means that you must take safety training to use it, have special equipment to transport limited quantities, and it must be contained to production until destruction. <br>
We are kept safe from benzene by:
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the properties of materials </li>
	<li>Careful and clever design and process engineering </li>
	<li>Placing personal safety and environmental protection as the to priority </li>
	<li>Effective regulations </li>
</ul>
