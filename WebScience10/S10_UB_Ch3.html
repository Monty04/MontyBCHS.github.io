  <h1>Program of Studies</h1>
  <h1>Unit B:  Energy Flow in Technological Systems (Science and Technology Emphasis) </h1>
  <strong>Overview:</strong> The first and second laws (conservation and conversion) of thermodynamics have been 		useful in the development of modern and efficient energy conversion devices.  Students investigating mechanical energy conversions and transfers in systems will recognize that while energy is conserved, useful energy diminishes with each conversion.  Students learn that energy can be observed only when it is being transferred, and that mechanical energy can be quantified.  Energy conservation and conversion concepts are applied by students to explain energy conversions in natural and technological systems, and to investigate the design and function of energy conversion technologies.

            <span class="def">Useful energy output </span>– the energy taken out of the situation to do a specific task. <br>
            Lost energy is the part of the energy input that is changed into non-useful energy (heat due to friction) <br>
            For example out of 100 J worth of fuel that you put into a car, only 14 to 30 J is used to propel the car forward (useful energy) the remaining energy is lost as heat. <br>

 			<h3 class="S10Bc">Efficiency </h3>
            <b>Efficiency </b>- is a measure of how much of the input energy is changed into useful output energy. <br>

            <h2 class="S10Bbg secTitle">B3.4  Energy Applications </h2>
            <h3 class="S10Bc">Energy Supply </h3>
            <b>Solar Energy Sources </b> <br>
            The Sun is a ball of superheated gases that undergo a fusion nuclear reaction to release light energy.  When the light hits the Earth it is changed into several different types of energy. <br>
            Wind energy is caused by the uneven heating of Earth’s atmosphere.  As sections warm up the air expands outwards causing wind. <br>
            Water energy is caused by the evaporation of water.  The evaporated water rises up through the atmosphere and falls as precipitation.  The rain hits the ground and flows downhill to the oceans.  The river can be dammed and used to create hydro-electric energy. <br>
             <br>
            Biomass energy is released when biological matter is combusted.  Plants use the sunlight to growth by creating glucose (sugar).  By burning the glucose in the biomass we can use the energy. <br>	
                    <ul>
                        <li>Garbage</li>
                        <li>Landfill gases</li>
                        <li>Alcohol foods</li>
                        <li>Crops</li>
                        <li>Wood</li>
                    </ul>
            Fossil Fuels are simply biomass that has been underground with high heat and pressure for millions of years.  The biomass slowly converts into fossil fuels which we burn to release their energy. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Non-Solar Energy Sources </b> <br>
            Non-solar energy sources are not related to the Sun. <br>
            Geothermal energy is caused by the heat of Earth’s interior.  Superheated water deep underground forces its way to the surface where it erupts as a geyser.  Geothermal plants use the steam to create electricity. <br>
             <br>
            Tidal energy is caused by the force of gravity of the moon on the Earth’s oceans.  The oceans move towards the moon causing tides.  The moving water can be used to create electrical energy. <br>
             <br>
            <b>Renewable and Non-renewable Energy Sources </b> <br>
            Renewable energy sources are constantly being recreated.  For example solar, wind, water, geothermal, tidal and biomass.  For all practical implications these are unlimited sources.
            Non-renewable energy sources can only be used once.  For example nuclear and fossil fuels.  Once they are used, they are gone forever. <br>
            <h3 class="S10Bc">Energy Demand </h3>
            Energy demand has been increasing over time.  Three factors have led to this: 
            <ol>
                <li>Each person uses more energy today than people have used previously. </li>
                <li>The world’s population has been growing exponentially.  See graph page 223.  A few countries like China have imposed population restrictions. </li>
                <li>The world is heavily dependent on non-renewable energy sources. Alberta’s electricity is mostly powered by coal. </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="S10Bc">The Effects of Energy Use </h3>
            The widespread use of fossil fuels has resulted in many problems <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Greenhouse gases are released by burning fossil fuels. </li>
                <li>Smog is created by burning fossil fuels </li>
                <li>Oil tanker spills destroy marine habitats </li>
                <li>Oil drilling has environmental consequences. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="S10Bc">Energy Consumption and Conservation </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Our supply of conventional oil is expected to last 40 years from 2000 which means in 2040 we will run out of oil. (estimated) </li>
                <li>Our supply of natural gas is expected to last 62 years from 2000, which means in 2060 we will run out of natural gas. (estimated) </li>
                <li>	Both of these events will occur within your lifetime! </li>
            </ul>
            Using less energy now will only delay the inevitable exhausting of non-renewable fossil fuel supplies.  Conservation of resources will help but is not a final solution. <br>
            <h3 class="S10Bc">Sustainable Development and Planning for the Future </h3>
            Sustainable development means continuing to improve living conditions but at a rate and using technology that will be viable forever.  <br>
            For example designing cars that run on solar power, using geothermal plants for heating and electricity.  <br>
