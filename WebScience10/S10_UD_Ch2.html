				<h1>Program of Studies</h1>
				<h1>Unit D: Energy Flow in Global Systems (Social and Environmental Contexts Emphasis) </h1>
				<strong>Overview: </strong> Solar energy sustains life and drives the global climate systems on Earth.  Without solar energy there would be no heat or precipitation and, therefore, no life on Earth. Students will gain an understanding that the absorption and transfer of thermal energy at and near Earth’s surface results in a variety of climate zones with characteristic weather patterns and biomes. Climatic factors largely determine the flora and fauna found in each of the world’s major biomes. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that the balance of evidence suggests a human influence on global climate. Scientists from various fields are studying this relationship to determine the potential impact on biomes

	<span class="def">Thermal energy </span>- is the energy possessed by a substance by virtue of the kinetic energy of its molecules or atoms. <br>
	 <h2 class="S10Dbg secTitle">D2.1  Energy Relationships and the Biosphere</h2>
	<span class="def">Radiant energy </span>- energy that is transmitted as electromagnetic waves. <br>
All energy on Earth initially comes from the sun (solar energy). <br>
A small amount of the incoming energy is changed into food energy by photosynthesis.  Much is absorbed as thermal energy (heat) in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere, and much is reflected back into space, depending on albedo. <br>
<span class="def">Latitudes </span>- imaginary circles around the Earth parallel to the equator. <br>
The latitudes go from 0<sup>o</sup> at the equator to 90<sup>o</sup> at the north and south poles. <br>
As the latitude increases the amount of solar energy per m<sup>2</sup> decreases.  Northern and southern latitudes are colder than at the equator because they don't get as much solar energy. <br>
The Earth is also inclined (tilted) compared to the Sun.  This causes the seasons (summer, winter, etc...) as the Earth rotates around the Sun. <br>
<span class="def">Solstice </span>- is one of two points in Earth's orbit at which the poles are the most tilted toward or away from the Sun. <br>
<span class="def">Equinox </span>- is one of two points in Earth's orbit when the number of daylight hours is equal to the number of hours of night. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Dc">Insolation and the Angle of Inclination </h3> <br>
<span class="def">Angle of incidence </span>- is the angle between a ray falling on a surface and the line perpendicular to that surface. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Dc">Absorption and Reflection by the Biosphere </h3> 
<span class="def">Reflect </span>- when electromagnetic energy (light) bounces off in another direction. <br>
<span class="def">Absorb </span>- when electromagnetic energy (light) is changed into another type of energy in the object struck by the electromagnetic energy.  In this case the light energy heats the greenhouse gas. <br>
Atmospheric dust and clouds can reduce how much energy gets to the ground and increase how much is reflected. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Dc">Albedo - Reflection by the Lithosphere and Hydrosphere </h3>
<span class="def">Albedo </span>- is a measurement the amount of solar energy that is reflected from the Earth. <br>
The albedo is affected by the material (water, snow, asphalt, concrete, grass, etc…) and whether it is reflective or not. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Dc">Natural Greenhouse Effect </h3>
<span class="def">Natural Greenhouse effect </span>- absorption of thermal energy by the atmosphere. <br>
<span class="def">Greenhouse gases </span>- gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Dc">Net Radiation Budget </h3>
	Net radiation budget describes how much energy comes to the Earth, how much is reflected and how much is absorbed. <br>
	Net budget = solar energy = absorbed + reflected <br>
	Absorbed = solar energy - reflected energy <br>

	<h3 class="S10Dc">Conduction and Convection </h3>
