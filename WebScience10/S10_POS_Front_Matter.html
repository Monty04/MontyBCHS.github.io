			<h1>Science 10 Program of Studies</h1>
			2005 - Updated 2014
			<h1><center>PROGRAM RATIONALE AND PHILOSOPHY </center> </h1>
			Students graduating from Alberta schools require the scientific and related technological knowledge and skills that will enable them to understand and interpret their world and become productive members of society. They also need to develop attitudes that will motivate them to use their knowledge and skills in a responsible manner. Science programs provide opportunities for students to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes that they need to explore interests and prepare for further education and careers.  <br>
			To become scientifically literate, students must develop a thorough knowledge of science and its relationship to technologies and society. They must also develop the broad-based skills needed to identify and analyze problems; explore and test solutions; and seek, interpret and evaluate information. To ensure that the science program is relevant to students as well as societal needs, it must present science in meaningful context—providing opportunities for students to explore the process of science, its applications and implications, and to examine related technological problems and issues. By doing so, students become aware of the role of science in responding to social and cultural change and in meeting needs for a sustainable environment, economy and society. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Program Vision </strong> <br>
			The secondary science program is guided by the vision that all students have the opportunity to develop scientific literacy. The goal of scientific literacy is to develop the science-related knowledge, skills and attitudes that students need to solve problems and make decisions, and at the same time help them become lifelong learners—maintaining their sense of wonder about the world around them. <br>
			Diverse learning experiences within the Science 10 program provide students with opportunities to explore, analyze and appreciate the interrelationships among science, technology, society and the environment, and to develop understandings that will affect their personal lives, their careers and their futures. <br>

			<h2>Goals </h2>
			The following goals for Canadian science education are addressed through the Alberta science program. Science education will:
			<ul>
				<li>encourage students at all grade levels to develop a critical sense of wonder and curiosity about scientific and technological endeavours </li>
				<li>enable students to use science and technology to acquire new knowledge and solve problems, so that they may improve the quality of their own lives and the lives of others </li>
				<li>prepare students to critically address science-related societal, economic, ethical and environmental issues  </li>
				<li>provide students with a foundation in science that creates opportunities for them to pursue progressively higher levels of study, prepares them for science-related occupations, and engages them in science-related hobbies appropriate to their interests and abilities </li>
				<li>enable students, of varying aptitudes and interests, to develop a knowledge of the wide spectrum of careers related to science, technology and the environment. </li>
			</ul>

			<strong>Aboriginal Perspectives  </strong> <br>
			Science 10 incorporates Aboriginal perspectives in order to develop, in all students, an appreciation of the cultural diversity and achievements of First Nations, Métis and Inuit (FNMI) peoples. <br>
			Science 10 is designed to:
			<ul>
				<li>acknowledge the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to understandings of the natural world </li>
				<li>support relational thinking by integrating learning from various disciplines of science </li>
				<li>develop the concept of our connectivity to the natural world and the importance of caring for the environment </li>
				<li>foster the development of positive attitudes by providing experiences that encourage all students to feel confident about their ability to succeed in science. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>PROGRAM FOUNDATIONS </h2>
			To support the development of science literacy, school programs must provide a foundation of learning experiences that address critical aspects of science and its application. These critical areas—the foundations of the program—provide general direction for the program and identify major components of its structure. <br>

			<center> <h2>Foundation 1: Science, Technology and Society (STS) </h2> </center>
			Foundation 1 is concerned with understanding the scope and character of science, its connections to technology, and the social context in which it is developed. The following is a brief introduction to the major ideas that underlie this component of the program. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Nature of Science </strong> <br>
			Science provides an ordered way of learning about the nature of things, based on observation and evidence. Through science, we explore our environment, gather knowledge and develop ideas that help us interpret and explain what we see. Scientific activity provides a conceptual and theoretical base that is used in predicting, interpreting and explaining natural and technological phenomena. Science is driven by a combination of specific knowledge, theory and experimentation. Science-based ideas are continually being tested, modified and improved as new knowledge and explanations supersede existing knowledge and explanations. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Science and Technology </strong> <br>
			Technology is concerned with solving practical problems that arise from human needs. Historically, the development of technology has been strongly linked to the development of science, with each making contributions to the other. While there are important relationships and interdependencies, there are also important differences. Where the focus of science is on the development and verification of knowledge, in technology the focus is on the development of solutions, involving devices and systems that meet a given need within the constraints of the problem. The test of science knowledge is that it helps us explain, interpret and predict; the test of technology is that it works—it enables us to achieve a given purpose. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Social and Environmental Contexts of Science and Technology </strong> <br>
			The history of science shows that scientific development takes place within a social context. Many examples can be used to show that cultural and intellectual traditions have influenced the focus and methodologies of science, and that science in turn has influenced the wider world of ideas. <br>
				<br>
			Today, research is often driven by societal and environmental needs and issues. As technological solutions have emerged from previous research, many of the new technologies have given rise to complex social and environmental issues. Increasingly, these issues are becoming part of the political agenda. The potential of science to inform and empower decision making by individuals, communities and society is a central role of scientific literacy in a democratic society. <br>
				<br>
			<center> <h2>Foundation 2: Knowledge </h2> </center>
			Foundation 2 focuses on the subject matter of science, including the theories, models, concepts and principles that are essential to an understanding of each science area. For organizational purposes, this foundation is framed using widely accepted science disciplines. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Life Science </strong> <br>
			Life science deals with the growth and interactions of life forms within their environments in ways that reflect their uniqueness, diversity, genetic continuity and changing nature. Life science includes such fields of study as ecosystems, biological diversity, the study of organisms, the study of the cell, biochemistry, genetic engineering and biotechnology. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Physical Science </strong> <br>
			Physical science, which encompasses chemistry and physics, deals with matter, energy and forces. Matter has structure, and there are interactions among its components. Energy links matter to gravitational, electromagnetic and nuclear forces in the universe. The conservation laws of mass and energy, and of momentum and charge, are addressed in physical science. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Earth and Space Science </strong> <br>
			Earth and space science brings global and universal perspectives to student knowledge. Earth, our home planet, exhibits form, structure and patterns of change, as does our surrounding solar system and the physical universe beyond it. 
			Earth and space science includes such fields of study as geology, meteorology and astronomy.  <br>
				<br>
			<center> <h2>Foundation 3: Skills </h2> </center>
			Foundation 3 is concerned with the skills that students develop in answering questions, solving problems and making decisions. While these skills are not unique to science, they play an important role in the development of scientific understandings and in the application of science and technology to new situations. Four broad skill areas are outlined in this program of studies. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Initiating and Planning </strong> <br>
			These are the skills of questioning, identifying problems and developing preliminary ideas and plans. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Performing and Recording </strong> <br>
			These are the skills of carrying out a plan of action that involves gathering evidence by observation and, in most cases, manipulating materials and equipment. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Analyzing and Interpreting </strong> <br>
			These are the skills of examining information and evidence; processing and presenting data so that it can be interpreted; and interpreting, evaluating and applying the results. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Communication and Teamwork </strong> <br>
			In science, as in other areas, communication skills are essential at every stage where ideas are being developed, tested, interpreted, debated and agreed upon. Teamwork skills are also important, as the development and application of science ideas is a collaborative process both in society and in the classroom. <br>
				<br>
			<center> <h2>Foundation 4: Attitudes </h2> </center>
			Foundation 4 is concerned with generalized aspects of behaviour-commonly referred to as attitudes. Attitude outcomes are of a different form than outcomes for skills and knowledge; they are exhibited in a different way, and they have deeper roots in the experiences that students bring to school. Attitude development is a lifelong process that involves the home, the school, the community and society at large. <br>
			Attitudes are best shown not by the events of a particular moment but by the pattern of behaviours over time. Development of positive attitudes plays an important role in students’ growth by interacting with their intellectual development and creating a readiness for responsible application of what is learned. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Interest in Science </strong> <br>
			Students will be encouraged to develop enthusiasm and continuing interest in the study of science. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Mutual Respect </strong> <br>
			Students will be encouraged to appreciate that scientific understanding evolves from the interaction of ideas involving people with different views and backgrounds. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Scientific Inquiry </strong> <br>
			Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support active inquiry, problem solving and decision making. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Collaboration </strong> <br>
			Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support collaborative activity. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Stewardship </strong> <br>
			Students will be encouraged to develop responsibility in the application of science and technology in relation to society and the natural environment. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Safety </strong> <br>
			Students will be encouraged to demonstrate a concern for safety in science and technology contexts. <br>
				<br>

			<strong>Unit Organization </strong> <br>
			In Science 10, four units of study are outlined. Each unit includes the following components. 
				<br>
			<strong>Unit Overview </strong> <br>
			Each unit of study begins with an overview that introduces the contents of the unit and suggests an approach to its development. 
				<br>
			<strong>Focusing Questions </strong> <br>
			These questions frame a context for introducing the unit and suggest a focus for investigative activities and application of ideas by students.
				<br>
			<strong>Links to Science </strong> <br>
			This section lists the science concepts and skills, relevant to the unit, that are part of the Alberta Science Grades 7–8–9 Program of Studies. 
				<br>
			<strong>Key Concepts </strong> <br>
			Key concepts identify major ideas to be developed in each unit. Some of the key concepts may be addressed in additional units of the same course, as well as at other grade/course levels. The intended scope of treatment of these concepts is indicated by the outcomes. 
					<br>
			<strong>Outcomes </strong> <br>
			Two levels of outcomes are provided in this program of studies. 
			<ul>
				<li>General Outcomes: These are the major outcomes for each unit. For Foundations 1 and 2 (STS and knowledge), the outcomes are combined and unique to each unit. For Foundation 3 (skills) and Foundation 4 (attitudes), the outcomes are common to all units. </li>
				<li>Specific Outcomes: These are detailed outcomes that flesh out the scope of each unit. They are shown in bulleted form.  </li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Examples</strong> <br>
			Many of the outcomes are supported by examples. The <strong>examples do not form part of the required program </strong>but are provided as an illustration of how the outcomes might be developed. Illustrative examples are written in italics and are separated from the outcomes by being placed in parentheses. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Links to Mathematics </strong> <br>
			The purpose of the links to mathematics is to identify mathematical concepts and skills related to science content in the science units of study.  The mathematics links identify where similar concepts and skills are developed in the mathematics programs of study to support making connections between mathematics and science learning, to build upon previous student learning, and to identify possible connections to mathematics learning that students may encounter. These links do not represent learning outcomes for science and are not considered prerequisites for Alberta science courses. <br>
				<br>
			<strong>Unit Emphases </strong> <br>
			Each unit of study begins with an overview and a set of focusing questions that identify a context for study. In defining the context, one of the following areas of emphasis is identified for each unit. 
			<ul>
				<li>Nature of Science Emphasis: In these units, student attention is focused on the processes by which scientific knowledge is developed and tested, and on the nature of the scientific knowledge itself. The skills emphasized in these units are the skills of scientific inquiry. </li>
				<li>Science and Technology Emphasis: In these units, students seek solutions to practical problems by developing and testing prototypes, products and techniques to meet a given need. The skills emphasized are those of problem solving, in combination with the skills of scientific inquiry. </li>
				<li>Social and Environmental Contexts Emphasis: In these units, student attention is focused on issues and decisions relating to how science and technology are applied. Skill emphasis is on the use of research and inquiry skills to inform the decision-making process; students seek and analyze information and consider a variety of perspectives. </li>
