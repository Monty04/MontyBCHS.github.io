		<h1>SCIENCE 10</h1>
		<h1>Program of Studies</h1>
		<h1>Unit A:  Energy and Matter in Chemical Change (Nature of Science Emphasis)</h1>
		<strong>Overview:</strong> Chemical changes involve energy and transformations of matter.  A knowledge of the underlying structure of matter and the basic chemical species is important in understanding chemical changes.  As students explore the properties of molecular and ionic compounds, including acids and bases, they begin to appreciate the need for a classification scheme and a system of nomenclature. Students classify, name compounds and write balanced chemical equations to represent chemical changes.  As well, students are introduced to the law of conservation of mass and the mole concept.
