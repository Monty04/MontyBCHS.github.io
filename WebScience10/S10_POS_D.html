			<h1>Program of Studies</h1>
			<h1>Unit D: Energy Flow in Global Systems (Social and Environmental Contexts Emphasis) </h1>
			<strong>Overview: </strong> Solar energy sustains life and drives the global climate systems on Earth.  Without solar energy there would be no heat or precipitation and, therefore, no life on Earth. Students will gain an understanding that the absorption and transfer of thermal energy at and near Earth’s surface results in a variety of climate zones with characteristic weather patterns and biomes. Climatic factors largely determine the flora and fauna found in each of the world’s major biomes. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that the balance of evidence suggests a human influence on global climate. Scientists from various fields are studying this relationship to determine the potential impact on biomes
