				<h1>Program of Studies</h1>
				<h1>Unit D: Energy Flow in Global Systems (Social and Environmental Contexts Emphasis) </h1>
				<strong>Overview: </strong> Solar energy sustains life and drives the global climate systems on Earth.  Without solar energy there would be no heat or precipitation and, therefore, no life on Earth. Students will gain an understanding that the absorption and transfer of thermal energy at and near Earth’s surface results in a variety of climate zones with characteristic weather patterns and biomes. Climatic factors largely determine the flora and fauna found in each of the world’s major biomes. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that the balance of evidence suggests a human influence on global climate. Scientists from various fields are studying this relationship to determine the potential impact on biomes

		Humans tend to live in more temperate climates (more near equator than arctic). <br>
		<span class="ex">Ex. </span>
		<ul>
			<li class="example">Californians use less heating fuel than Albertans. </li>
			<li class="example">Californians use more fuel for air conditioning (cooling) than Albertans. </li>
			<li class="example">Albertans stay indoor in the winter, Californians stay indoors in the summer. </li>
		</ul>
		 <br>
		<h3 class="S10Dc">Climate affects all organisms </h3> <br>
		<span class="def">Adaptation </span>- is any change in the structure or functionaing of an organism that makes it more suited to its environment. <br>
		Most organisms (plants and animals) have adaptations to fit the climate in which they live. <br>
		<span class="ex">Ex. </span>
		<ul>
			<li class="example">Arctic animals are white and carry a lot of fat. </li>
			<li class="example">Savannah animals are tan coloured and run fast. </li>
			<li class="example">Desert plants live in the shade and store water. </li>
		</ul>
		 <br>
		<h3 class="S10Dc">Climate Change </h3> <br>
		Climate change has scientific evidence (measurements) and anecdotal evidence (personal accounts) that the climate is changing.  Over the past 100 years the planet and atmosphere have been warming. <br>
