	Multicellular organism are larger than unicellular organisms because:
	<ul>
		<li>Division of Labour - cells can specialize for a specific function so it can perform more efficiently. </li>
		<li>Size - the surface area to volume relationship limits the size of unicellular organisms. </li>
		<li>Interdependence of cells - multicellular organisms do not rely on a single cell and can survive significant damage. </li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">Plant Structure </h3>
	Groups of cells form tissues. <br>
	Tissuses contributing to the same functions form organs. <br>
	Organs working together form systems. <br>
	Systems working together form organisms. <br>
	 <br>


	Plants have two systems:
	<ul>
		<li>Shoot system is everything above ground level. </li>
		<li>The root system is everything underground, but also includes roots above the ground. </li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">Specialization in Plant Cells </h3>
	Plant cells specialize and perform very different functions such as:
	Cells that are part of the root system produce root hairs
	Dermal cells of the shoot system produce cuticles <br>
	<br>
	The lower epidermal of leaves develop guard cells, that form tiny pores called stomata for gas exchange.
	Cells in the xylem and vascular system conduct water throughout the plant. <br>

       <h3 class="S10Cc">The Particle Model of Matter </h3>
	<span class="def">Chloroplast: </span>  responsible for photosynthesis, unique to plant cells. <br>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">Gas Production in Plants </h3>
	Plants get energy by photosynthesis in the presence of light.  However, during the night plants survive by cellular respiration, the same process that animals use. <br>
	Photosynthesis:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub> <br>
	Cellular Respiration: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 6 CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O <br>
	Fortunately, plants produce far more oxygen during the day then they use at night, so there is lots of extra oxygen for us to breath. <br>

	The reactants for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water.  We will look at the systems responsible:
	<ul>
		<li> how gases (carbon dioxide &amp; oxygen) get in and out of the leaf.</li>
		<li> how water (through transpiration) get into the leaf. </li>

          <h2 class="S10Cbg secTitle">C3.3 The Leaf Tissues and Gas Exchange </h2>
	We will look at two systems in the plant. 
	Breathing in (CO<sub>2</sub>) and out (O<sub>2</sub>) of gases through the bottom of the leaves.
	Transpiration which transports water and dissolved minerals from the ground up to the leaves.
	Water comes from vascular bundles and the air comes from the stroma.  Photosynthesis takes place in the mesophyll layers. <br>
	<span class="def">Vascular bundle </span>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="def">Lenticels </span>- a raised spongy region in the stem of a woody plant that allows gas exchange between the atmosphere and the interior of the plant. </li>
			<li><span class="def">Transpiration </span>- The process of water vapour leaving the leaf through the stomata.  Without control by the guard cells, transpiration could dangerously dehydrate a plant. </li>
		</ul>
	<h3 class="S10Cc">Sensitivity of Stomata </h3>


	<h3 class="S10Cc">Ground Tissue </h3>
	<span class="def">Mesophyll </span>- specialized ground tissue inside a leaf, made up of thin-walled cells containing chloroplasts. <br>
	<span class="def">Palisade tissue cells </span>- column-shaped mesophyll cells in a plant leaf; responsible for photosynthesis. <br>
	<span class="def">Spongy mesophyll tissue </span>- layer of loosely-spaced mesophyll cells in a leaf; the increased distance between cells promotes diffusion. <br>

	Make a sketch

	Microscopic view of the paired guard cells and stoma on the leaf surface of spiderwort (Tradescantia). 
	An opening or stoma develops between the inflated (turgid) guard cells due to a differential thickening of their walls. When the guard cells lose water pressure on a hot day, they deflate and push together, thus closing off the stoma and reducing water loss (transpiration) through the leaf. <br>



	<span class="def">Vascular tissue </span>- transport tissue formed of cells joined into tubes that carry water and nutrients through the body of the plant.  There are 2 different types of vascular tissue. <br>
	<span class="def">Xylem tissue </span>- vascular tissue that conducts water and minerals from the roots to the leaves in plants. <br>
	<span class="def">Phloem tissue </span>- vascular tissue that transports carbohydrates and water from the leaves to other parts of the plant. <br>
	<span class="def">Sieve tube cells </span>- cylindrical cells lacking nuclei and with perforated sides and end walls that allow the movement of phloem in plants. <br>
	<span class="def">Companion cells </span>- type of small phloem cells adjacent to sieve tube cells that appear to control sugar transport in the phloem. <br>

	<span class="def">Adhesion </span>- the attractions of molecules to other type of molecules. <br>

	<h3 class="S10Cc">Photosynthesis </h3>

	<span class="def">Root pressure </span>- upwards force exerted on water in the xylem in the roots of some plants.  The root cells have a higher concentration than the surrounding dirt (hypotonic) which draws water into the roots (osmosis). <br>
	From Root to Leaf:  Water Transport in Plants <br>
	<span class="def">Tension </span>- a stress cause by the action of a pulling force. <br>
	<span class="def">Transpiration pull </span>- the tension or pull on water molecules in the xylem due to evaporation of water through the stomata or lenticels in a plant. <br>
	From Source to Sink: Sugar Transport in Plants<br>
	<span class="def">Pressure-flow theory </span>- explanation of plant nutrient transport from leaves to other parts of the plant, driven by the pressure build-up of hypertonic solution in leaf phloem. <br>
	<span class="def">Pressure differences </span>- the difference in pressure in two areas that may cause movement of substances. <br>
