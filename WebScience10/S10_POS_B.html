			<h1>SCIENCE 10</h1>
			<h1>Program of Studies</h1>
			<h1>Unit B:  Energy Flow in Technological Systems (Science and Technology Emphasis) </h1>
			<strong>Overview:</strong> The first and second laws (conservation and conversion) of thermodynamics have been 
			useful in the development of modern and efficient energy conversion devices.  Students investigating mechanical energy conversions and transfers in systems will recognize that while energy is conserved, useful energy diminishes with each conversion.  Students learn that energy can be observed only when it is being transferred, and that mechanical energy can be quantified.  Energy conservation and conversion concepts are applied by students to explain energy conversions in natural and technological systems, and to investigate the design and function of energy conversion technologies.
