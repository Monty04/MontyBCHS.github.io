			<strong>PROGRAM RATIONALE AND PHILOSOPHY </strong> <br>
			<p>Science programs provide opportunities for students to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to become productive and responsible members of society. The programs also allow students to explore interests and prepare for further education and careers. Students graduating from Alberta schools require the scientific and related technological knowledge and skills that will enable them to understand and interpret their world. They also need to develop attitudes that will motivate them to use their knowledge and skills in a responsible manner. </p>
		  <br>
			<p>To become scientifically literate, students need to develop a knowledge of science and its relationship to technologies and society. They also need to develop the broad-based skills required to identify and analyze problems; to explore and test solutions; and to seek, interpret and evaluate information. To ensure relevance to students as well as to societal needs, a science program must present science in a meaningful context—providing opportunities for students to explore the process of science, its applications and implications, and to examine related technological problems and issues. By doing so, students become aware of the role of science in responding to social and cultural change and in meeting needs for a sustainable environment, economy and society. </p>
		  <br>
			<strong>Program Vision </strong> <br>
			<p>The secondary science program is guided by the vision that all students, regardless of gender or cultural background, are given the opportunity to develop scientific literacy. The goal of scientific literacy is to develop in students the science-related knowledge, skills and attitudes that they need to solve problems and make decisions and, at the same time, to help students become lifelong learners who maintain their sense of wonder about the world around them. </p>
		  <br>
			<p>Diverse learning experiences within the science program provide students with opportunities to explore, analyze and appreciate the interrelationships among science, technology, society and the environment and to develop understandings that will affect their </p>
		  <br>
			<strong>Goals</strong>
			<p>The following goals for Canadian science education, developed in the Common Framework of Science Learning Outcomes K to 12: Pan-Canadian Protocol for Collaboration on School Curriculum (1997), are addressed through the Alberta science program. Science education will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>encourage students at all grade levels to develop a critical sense of wonder and curiosity about scientific and technological endeavours </li>
				<li>enable students to use science and technology to acquire new knowledge and solve problems so that they may improve the quality of their lives and the lives of others </li>
				<li>prepare students to critically address science-related societal, economic, ethical and environmental issues </li>
				<li>provide students with a foundation in science that creates opportunities for them to pursue progressively higher levels of study, prepares them for science-related occupations and engages them in science-related hobbies appropriate to their interests and abilities </li>
				<li>develop in students of varying aptitudes and interests a knowledge of the wide spectrum of careers related to science, technology and the environment.</li>
			</ul>
				<strong>Aboriginal Perspectives </strong> <br>
				<p>Courses in the senior high school sciences incorporate Aboriginal perspectives in order to develop, in all students, an appreciation of the cultural diversity and achievements of First Nations, Métis and Inuit (FNMI) peoples. These courses are designed to: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>acknowledge the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to understandings of the natural world </li>
				<li>support relational thinking by integrating learning from various disciplines of science </li>
				<li>develop the concept of humankind's connectivity to the natural world and foster an appreciation for the importance of caring for the environment </li>
				<li>foster the development of positive attitudes by providing experiences that encourage all students to feel confident about their ability to succeed in science.</li>
			</ul>
				<strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) </strong> <br>
				<p>Selected curriculum outcomes from Alberta Education's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Program of Studies are infused throughout the 20-level and 30-level sciences so that students will develop a broad perspective on the nature of technology, learn how to use and apply a variety of technologies, and consider the impact of ICT on individuals and society. The infusion of ICT outcomes supports and reinforces the understandings and abilities that students are expected to develop within Foundation 3 (Science, Technology and Society) and Foundation 4 (Skills) of these courses. Effective, efficient and ethical application of ICT outcomes contributes to the program vision.</p>
			<br>
				<p>Infusion of ICT outcomes provides learning opportunities for students to: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>understand the nature of technology and apply terminology appropriately </li>
				<li>use equipment carefully and share limited ICT resources </li>
				<li>use technology in an ethical manner, including respecting the ownership of information and digital resources and citing electronic sources </li>
				<li>use technology safely, including applying ergonomic principles and appropriate safety procedures </li>
				<li>use the Internet safely, including protecting personal information and avoiding contact with strangers </li>
				<li>use technology appropriately, including following communication etiquette and respecting the privacy of others. </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
				<h3>PROGRAM FOUNDATIONS </h3>
				<p>To support the development of scientific literacy, a science program must provide learning experiences that address critical aspects of science and its application. These foundations provide a general direction for the program and identify the major components of its structure. </p>


				<img src="POS-Program-Rationale-and-Philosophy.png" width="640" height="360" alt="Program of Studies Foundations"/> <br>
				<strong>Foundation 1 </strong> <br>
				<p>Attitudes—Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support the responsible acquisition and application of scientific and technological knowledge to the mutual benefit of self, society and the environment. </p>
				<strong>Foundation 2 </strong> <br>
				<p>Knowledge—Students will construct knowledge and understandings of concepts in life science, physical science and Earth and space science, and apply these understandings to interpret, integrate and extend their knowledge. </p>
				<strong>Foundation 3 </strong> <br>
				<p>Science, Technology and Society (STS)—Students will develop an understanding of the nature of science and technology, the relationships between science and technology, and the social and environmental contexts of science and technology. </p>
				<strong>Foundation 4 </strong> <br>
				<p>Skills—Students will develop the skills required for scientific and technological inquiry, for solving problems, for communicating scientific ideas and results, for working collaboratively and for making informed decisions. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Foundation 1: Attitudes </h3>
				<p>Foundation 1 is concerned with the generalized aspects of behaviour that are commonly referred to as attitudes. Attitude outcomes are of a different form than outcomes for skills and knowledge: they are exhibited in a different way, and they are rooted more deeply in the experiences that students bring to school. Attitude development is a lifelong process that involves the home, the school, the community and society at large. Attitudes are best shown not by the events of a particular moment but by the pattern of behaviours over time. Development of positive attitudes plays an important role in student growth by interacting with students' intellectual development and by creating a readiness for responsible application of what is learned. </p>
				<strong>Interest in Science </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will be encouraged to develop enthusiasm and continuing interest in the study of science. </p>
				<strong>Mutual Respect </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will be encouraged to appreciate that scientific understanding evolves from the interaction of ideas involving people with different views and backgrounds. </p>
				<strong>Scientific Inquiry </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support active inquiry, problem solving and decision making. </p>
				<strong>Collaboration </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support collaborative activity. </p>
				<strong>Stewardship </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will be encouraged to develop responsibility in the application of science and technology in relation to society and the natural environment. </p>
				<strong>Safety </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will be encouraged to demonstrate a concern for safety in science and technology </p> contexts.
			<br>
			<h3>Foundation 2: Knowledge </h3>
				<p>Foundation 2 focuses on the subject matter of science, including the laws, theories, models, concepts and principles that are essential to an understanding of each science area. For organizational purposes, this foundation is framed using widely accepted science disciplines. </p>
				<strong>Life Science </strong> <br>
				<p>Life science deals with the growth and interactions of life forms within their environments in ways that reflect their uniqueness, diversity, genetic continuity and changing nature. Life science includes such fields of study as ecosystems, biological diversity, organisms, cells, biochemistry, genetic engineering and biotechnology. </p>
				<strong>Physical Science </strong> <br>
				<p>Physical science, which encompasses chemistry and physics, deals with matter, energy and forces. Matter has structure, and there are interactions among its components. Energy links matter to gravitational, electromagnetic and nuclear forces in the universe. Physical science also addresses the conservation laws of mass and energy, momentum and charge. </p>
				<strong>Earth and Space Science </strong> <br>
				<p>Earth and space science brings global and universal perspectives to student knowledge. The planet Earth exhibits form, structure and patterns of change, as does the surrounding solar system and the physical universe beyond it. Earth and space science includes such fields of study as geology, meteorology and astronomy. </p>
			<br>
				<p>Themes are the major ideas of science and technology that transcend discipline boundaries and demonstrate unity among the natural sciences. Six themes have been identified for the senior high school sciences program. </p>
				<strong>Change </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will develop an understanding of: </p>
				<p>How all natural entities are modified over time, how the direction of change might be predicted and, in some instances, how change can be controlled. </p>
				<strong>Diversity </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will develop an understanding of: </p>
				<p>The array of living and nonliving forms of matter and the procedures used to understand, classify and distinguish these forms of matter on the basis of recurring patterns. </p>
				<strong>Energy </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will develop an understanding of: </p>
				<p>The capacity for doing work that drives much of what takes place in the universe through its variety of interconvertible forms. </p>
				<strong>Equilibrium </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will develop an understanding of: </p>
				<p>The state in which opposing forces or processes balance in a static or dynamic way. </p>
				<strong>Matter </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will develop an understanding of: </p>
				<p>The constituent parts, and the variety of states, of the material in the physical world. </p>
				<strong>Systems </strong> <br>
				<p>Students will develop an understanding of: </p>
				<p>The interrelated groups of things or events that can be defined by their boundaries and, in some instances, by their inputs and outputs. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Foundation 3: Science, Technology and Society (STS) </h3>
				<p>Foundation 3 is concerned with understanding the scope and character of science, its connections to technology and the social context in which it is developed. The following is a brief introduction to the major ideas underlying this component of the program. </p>
				<strong>Nature of Science </strong> <br>
				<p>Science provides an ordered way of learning about the nature of things, based on observation and evidence. Through science, we explore our environment, gather knowledge and develop ideas that help us interpret and explain what we see. Scientific activity provides a conceptual and theoretical base that is used in predicting, interpreting and explaining natural and technological phenomena. Science is driven by a combination of specific knowledge, theory, observation and experimentation. Science-based ideas are continually being tested, modified and improved as new knowledge and explanations supersede existing knowledge and explanations. </p>
				<strong>Science and Technology </strong> <br>
				<p>Technology is concerned with solving practical problems that arise from human needs. Historically, the development of technology has been strongly linked to the development of science, with each making contributions to the other. While there are important relationships and interdependencies, there are also important differences. Whereas the focus of science is on the development and verification of knowledge, the focus of technology is on the development of solutions, involving devices and systems that meet a given need within the constraints of a problem. The test of scientific knowledge is that it helps us explain, interpret and predict; the test of technology is that it works—it enables us to achieve a given purpose. </p>
				<strong>Social and Environmental Contexts </strong> <br>
				<p>The history of science shows that scientific development takes place within a social context. Many examples can be used to show that cultural and intellectual traditions have influenced the focus and methodologies of science, and that science in turn has influenced the wider world of ideas. </p>
				<p>Today, research is often driven by societal and environmental needs and issues. As technological solutions have emerged from previous research, many of the new technologies have given rise to complex social and environmental issues. Increasingly, these issues are becoming part of the political agenda. The potential of science to inform and empower decision making by individuals, communities and society is central to scientific literacy in a democratic society.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Foundation 4: Skills </h3>
				<p>Foundation 4 is concerned with the skills that students develop in answering questions, solving problems and making decisions. While these skills are not unique to science, they play an important role in the development of scientific understandings and in the application of science and technology to new situations. Four broad skill areas are outlined in the secondary science program. Each skill area is developed at each level with increasing scope and complexity of application. </p>
				<strong>Initiating and Planning </strong> <br>
				<p>These are the skills of questioning, identifying problems and developing preliminary ideas and plans. </p>
				<strong>Performing and Recording </strong> <br>
				<p>These are the skills of carrying out a plan of action that include gathering evidence by observation and, in most cases, manipulating materials and equipment. </p>
				<strong>Analyzing and Interpreting </strong>
				<p>These are the skills of examining information and evidence; of processing and presenting data so that they can be interpreted; and of interpreting, evaluating and applying the results. </p>
				<strong>Communication and Teamwork </strong> <br>
				<p>In science, as in other areas, communication skills are essential at every stage during which ideas are being developed, tested, interpreted, debated and agreed upon. Teamwork skills are also important, as the development and application of science ideas are collaborative processes both in society and in the classroom. </p>
			<br>
				<h3>PROGRAM ORGANIZATION </h3>
				<strong>Attitude Outcomes </strong> <br>
				<p>A listing of Attitude outcomes is included at the beginning of each of the 20-level and 30-level courses in the senior high school sciences program. These specific outcomes are to be developed throughout the particular course in conjunction with the specific outcomes for Knowledge, STS and Skills listed within each unit of study. </p>
				<strong>Units of Study </strong> <br>
				<p>In the senior high school sciences program, four units of study are outlined for each course. Each unit in the 20-level and 30-level courses includes the following components. </p>
				<strong>Themes </strong> <br>
				<p>Themes are the major ideas of science that transcend topics of study. </p>
				<strong>Overview </strong> <br>
				<p>The overview introduces the contents of the unit and suggests an approach to unit development. </p>
			<br>
				<strong>Focusing Questions </strong> <br>
				<p>These questions frame a context for introducing the unit and suggest a focus for investigative activities and application of ideas by students. </p>
				<strong>Key Concepts </strong> <br>
				<p>Key concepts identify major ideas to be developed in the unit. Some of the concepts may be addressed in additional units of the same course, as well as in other courses. The intended scope of treatment of these concepts is indicated by the outcomes. </p>
				<strong>Outcomes </strong> <br>
				<p>Two levels of outcomes are provided in each unit: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>General Outcomes: These are the major outcomes in the unit that students are to demonstrate over the course of their learning. </li>
					<li>Specific Outcomes: These are detailed outcomes that delineate the scope of each general outcome and the unit. Specific outcomes for Knowledge; Science, Technology and Society (STS); and Skills are identified. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The outcomes are numbered for the purpose of referencing. This numbering is not intended to imply a fixed instructional sequence. </p>
				<strong>Examples </strong> <br>
				<p>Many of the outcomes are supported by examples. The examples are written in italics and do not form part of the required program but are provided as an illustration of how the outcomes might be developed. </p>
				<strong>STS Emphases </strong> <br>
				<p>The specific outcomes for Science, Technology and Society (STS) and Skills for each general outcome in a unit include one of the following emphases: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Nature of Science </li>
				<li>Science and Technology </li>
				<li>Social and Environmental Contexts </li>
			</ul>
				<p>The STS emphases provide opportunities for students to develop related concepts and skills as outlined on pages 8 to 10.</p>
				<strong>Additional Links </strong>
				<p>Links to the STS emphasis frameworks (pages 8 to 10) are shown in <strong>boldface</strong> and (in parentheses) after specific outcomes for STS and after specific outcomes or examples for Skills. Links to the Division 4 ICT curriculum (pages 11 to 13) are shown in <strong>boldface</strong> and [in brackets] after some of the specific outcomes and examples for STS and Skills. The STS and ICT links indicate that the concept or skill from the STS emphasis framework or the Division 4 ICT outcome has been addressed in the specific outcome or example. </p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The listing of STS and ICT links is not exhaustive; other links may exist.</p>
				<strong>Links to Mathematics </strong> <br>
				<p>The purpose of the links to mathematics is to identify mathematical concepts and skills related to science content in the science units of study. The mathematics links identify where similar concepts and skills are developed in the mathematics programs of study irrespective of course level or sequence and provide possible links to similar learning opportunities. The mathematics links are intended to support making connections between mathematics and science learning, to build upon previous student learning, and to identify possible connections to mathematics learning that students may encounter. These links do not represent learning outcomes for Science and are not considered prerequisites for Alberta science courses. </p>
