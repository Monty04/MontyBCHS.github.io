		<h1> Unit B: Dynamics </h1>
		<strong>Themes:</strong> Change and Systems <br>
		<strong>Overview:</strong> In this unit, students investigate causes of change in the position and velocity of objects and systems in a study of dynamics and gravitation. The concept of fields is introduced in the explanation of gravitational effects. <br>
		This unit builds on: <br>
		<ul>
			<li> Grade 7 Science, Unit D: Structures and Forces </li>
			<li> Science 10, Unit B: Energy Flow in Technological Systems </li>
			<li> Grade 8 Science, Unit D: Mechanical Systems </li>
			<li> Physics 20, Unit A: Kinematics </li>
		</ul>
		This unit prepares students for further study, in subsequent units and physics courses, of Newton’s laws, periodic motion and particles in electric and magnetic fields.  <br>
		  <br>
		Unit B will require approximately 25% of the time allotted for Physics 20. <br>
		Links to Mathematics: Refer to page 26. <br>

		<strong>Focusing Questions: </strong> <br>
		How does the understanding of forces help humans improve or change their environment? <br>
		How do the principles of dynamics influence the development of new mechanical technologies? <br>
		What role do gravitational effects play in the universe? <br>
		  <br>
		<strong> General Outcomes: </strong> <br>
