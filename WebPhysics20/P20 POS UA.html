		<h1> Unit A: Kinematics </h1>
		<strong>Themes:</strong> Change and Systems <br>
		<strong>Overview:</strong> In this unit, students investigate changes in the position and velocity of objects and systems in a study of kinematics. <br>
		This unit builds on: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>Grade 7 Science, Unit D: Structures and Forces </li>
			<li>Grade 8 Science, Unit D: Mechanical Systems </li>
			<li>Science 10, Unit B: Energy Flow in Technological Systems </li>
		</ul>
		This unit prepares students for further study, in subsequent units and physics courses, of dynamics, Newton’s laws and particles in gravitational, electric and magnetic fields. <br>
		  <br>
		Unit A will require approximately 15% of the time allotted for Physics 20. <br>
		Links to Mathematics: Refer to page 20. <br>
		  <br>
		<strong> Focusing Questions: </strong>
		<ul>
			<li>How do changes in position, velocity and acceleration allow us to predict the paths of moving objects and systems? </li>
			<li>How do the principles of kinematics influence the development of new mechanical technologies? </li>
		</ul>
			<strong>General Outcomes: </strong> <br>
		There is one major outcome in this unit. <br>
		Students will: <br>
		<h1> A1. describe motion in terms of displacement, velocity, acceleration and time. </h1>
		  <br>
		<strong>Key Concepts:</strong> The following concepts are developed in this unit and may also be addressed in other units or in other courses. The intended level and scope of treatment is defined by the outcomes. <br>
		<ul>
			<li>scalar quantities </li>
			<li>vector quantities </li>
			<li>uniform motion </li>
			<li>uniformly accelerated motion </li>
			<li>two-dimensional motion </li>

		<strong> Specific Outcomes for Science, Technology and Society (STS) </strong> (Nature of Science Emphasis) <br>
		Students will: <br>

		<ul>
			<li><em>identify common applications of kinematics, such as determining the average speed of a run, bike ride or car trip, or the acceleration required to launch an aircraft from a carrier </em> </li>
		</ul>
		   <br>

		<ul>
			<li><em>analyze lunar free fall as illustrated in a video</em> </li>
		</ul>

			<li>identify, define and delimit questions to investigate;  </li>
			<em> e.g., What are the relationships among displacement, velocity, acceleration and time? (IP–NS1) </em> 
			<li><em>explain why distances are measured in different units (as the crow flies, days of travel, mileage from city centre to city centre, light years). </em></li>
		</ul>	
		 <br>
		<strong> Performing and Recording </strong> <br>
		Students will: <br>
		20–A1.2s conduct investigations into relationships among observable variables and use a broad range of tools and techniques to gather and record data and information <br>
		<ul>
			<li>perform an experiment to demonstrate the relationships among displacement, velocity, acceleration and time, using available technologies;  </li>
			<em> e.g., interval timers, photo gates </em> (PR–NS2, PR–NS3) [ICT C6–4.4] <br>
			<li>collect information from various print and electronic sources to explain the use of kinematics concepts;  </li>
			<em> e.g., the synchronization of traffic lights </em> (PR–ST1) [ICT C1–4.1]. <br>
