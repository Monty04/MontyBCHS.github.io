		<h1>Unit D: Oscillatory Motion and Mechanical Waves</h1>
		<strong>Themes:</strong> Energy and Matter <br>
		<strong>Overview:</strong> In this unit, students investigate simple harmonic motion and mechanical waves. <br>
		This unit builds on: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>Science 10, Unit B: Energy Flow in Technological Systems </li>
			<li>Physics 20, Unit A: Kinematics;Unit B: Dynamics;and Unit C: Circular Motion, Work and Energy  </li>
		</ul>
		This unit prepares students for further study,in subsequent physics courses, of simple harmonic motion and wave phenomena. <br>
		  <br>
		Unit D will require approximately 30% of the time allotted for Physics 20. <br>
		Links to Mathematics: Refer to page 38. <br>
		  <br>
		<strong>Focusing Questions: </strong> <br>
		What are examples of oscillatory motion in the world around us? <br>
		How do mechanical waves transmit energy? How is structural design and the development of technologies influenced by our understanding of wave properties? <br>
		   <br>
		<strong> General Outcomes:</strong> <br>
		There are two major outcomes in this unit. <br>
