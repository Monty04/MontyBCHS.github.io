		<h1> Unit C: Circular Motion, Work and Energy </h1>
		<strong>Themes:</strong> Energy and Equilibrium <br>
		<strong>Overview: </strong>In this unit, students extend their study of kinematics and dynamics to uniform circular  <br>
		motion and to mechanical energy, work and power. <br>
		This unit builds on: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>Grade 8 Science, Unit D: Mechanical Systems </li>
			<li>Grade 9 Science, Unit E: Space Exploration </li>
			<li>Science 10, Unit B: Energy Flow in Technological Systems </li>
			<li>Physics 20, Unit A: Kinematics and Unit B: Dynamics </li>
		</ul>
		This unit prepares students for further study,in subsequent physics courses, of circular motion, conservation laws and particles in magnetic fields.  <br>
		 <br>
		Unit C will require approximately 30% of the time allotted for Physics 20. <br>
