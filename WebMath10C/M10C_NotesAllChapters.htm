                        <h3>General Notes</h3>
                        <p>Students have been working with SI units of measure since Grade 3. While the SI system of measure is the official measurement system in Canada, students need to have some exposure to and experience with imperial units of measure. Some commerce in Canada, primarily involving imports from and exports to the U.S., is still conducted in imperial units.</p>
                        <p>This is the first time that imperial units are formally addressed in the Kindergarten to Grade 12 curriculum.</p>
                        <p>In measurement, a referent is described as something common that provides students with a reference for a unit of measure. While there are some commonly used measurement referents, e.g., 1 foot is approximately the length of an adult’s foot, students are expected to develop their own referents for the basic units of length in each system.</p>
                        <p>Measurements in imperial units should generally be expressed in fraction form. This outcome is not intended to assess operations on fractions but can be used to reinforce students’ understanding of fractions.</p>
                        <p>A personal strategy must be efficient and accurate and the student must be able to explain it. A student may develop his or her own personal strategy or adopt a strategy developed by another student. The student must be able to explain his or her strategy to others.</p>
                        <p>Students have been encouraged to develop personal strategies throughout the Kindergarten to Grade 9 mathematics program and may employ some nontraditional methods in solving problems. Provided they meet the criteria above, these personal strategies should be accepted.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that students will use a variety of measuring instruments.</p>

                    <p>Proportional reasoning solves for an unknown value by comparing it to known values, using ratios. Students are expected to use and explain proportional reasoning when converting units within and between the two measurement systems.</p>
                    <p>Technology (T) has not been identified as one of the mathematical processes to be emphasized in completing this outcome. Technology may be used, where appropriate, in solving a proportion.</p>
                    <p>In unit analysis, students apply the process for multiplying and simplifying fractions to verify the units in the final solution to a problem. While the analysis in Achievement Indicator 2.3 will be quite straightforward, teachers may use conversion of units within or between the two measurement systems to introduce students to unit analysis.</p>
                    <p>Students are not expected to memorize conversion factors. Basic conversion factors, especially those between the SI and imperial systems of measure, e.g., inch ? centimetre, yard ? centimetre, should be provided.</p>
                    <p>The use of conversion programs is not appropriate.</p>

                    <p>Students may not be familiar with the terms least common multiple and greatest common factor as these terms are not formally introduced in previous grade levels. </p>

                    <p>A prime number is defined as a positive integer with two distinct divisors —1 and the number itself; thus, 1 is not a prime number.  </p>

                    <p>The correct response to the first question is ± 4, whereas the correct response to the second question is 4 (or + 4). The convention for the use of the square root symbol is that the symbol by itself ,e.g., the square root of 16 ( ), refers specifically to the principle (positive) square root of the number.   </p>
                    <p>The symbol for the negative square root includes a minus sign before the symbol; e.g.,the negative square root of 16 is -<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">&nbsp;16 &nbsp;</span></span> .</p>

                    <p> It is important that students are able to provide explanations for the restrictions on the variables in the definitions and exponent laws in Achievement Indicators 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.

                    <p> Students, from Kindergarten to Grade 9, have been encouraged to develop personal strategies for performing operations with numbers. In Achievement Indicator 4.3, students are therefore expected to explain the strategy they used for multiplying two-digit numbers; e.g., 15 × 23 = (10 + 5) (20 + 3). </p>

                    <h3>General Notes</h3>
                    <p> It is important that teachers view the nine specific outcomes in this topic as a package and not as individual outcomes. Teachers may choose to develop lessons and activities that include parts of several outcomes.</p>
                    <p> Prior knowledge from previous grade levels includes: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> an introduction to linear relations, including tables of values and graphs (Grade 7) </li>
                        <li> graphing and analyzing two-variable linear relations (Grade 8) </li>
                        <li> using linear relations to solve problems, including graphing,  interpolation and extrapolation (Grade 9). </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Technology [T] has been identified as one of the mathematical processes to be emphasized in completing this outcome. It is expected, however, that students will be able to graph both linear and nonlinear data with and without the use of technology.  </p>
                    <p> Students are expected to draw graphs that include a title, properly label led axes and appropriate scales. </p>
                    <p> For a given context, students are expected to identify key points on a graph, such as intercepts or points where the graph changes direction.  </p>
                    <p> While students may have previously discussed restrictions on the variables in a linear relation, this is the first time that the terms domain and range are addressed. Some ways students may describe the domain and range for a linear relation include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> written or verbal descriptions
                        <li> lists 
                        <li> set builder notation; e.g. ,{ <span class="equation">x |–2<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">&nbsp; &ge;&nbsp;</span> x < 3, x <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">&isin; &nbsp;</span>R</span> }</p>
                        <li> interval notation; e.g., (–2, 3).
                    </ul>
                    <p> It is essential that students understand and are able to use set builder notation and interval notation effectively since these will be the primary ways of describing sets of numbers in future courses including Mathematics 20-1 and 20-2. </p>
                    <p> Students are expected to distinguish between continuous and discrete data and understand their implications for a graph. </p>

                    <p> In Achievement Indicators 3.2 and 3.3, students are expected to draw conclusions, through investigation, about lines with a:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> positive or negative slope</li>
                        <li> slope of zero</li>
                        <li> slope that is undefined.</li>
    
                    </ul>
                    <p> In Achievement Indicator 3.8, students are expected to develop, through investigation, the rules for determining whether two lines are parallel or perpendicular.  </p>
                    <p> Slope can be referred to as a rate of change, specifically the rate of change of the variable y with respect to the change in the variable x. If slope is discussed in context, the units for each variable should be included with the slope; e.g., if the context provides a relationship between distance in meters and time in seconds, then the rate of change of distance with respect to time should be expressed in m/s and related to the slope of the graph. </p>
                    <p> The focus of this outcome is to develop a visual understanding of slope and then, when solving problems, to connect slope to the concept of rate of change.   </p>

            A point of intersection of the lines on a graph <br>

            A pair of values occurring in the tables of values of both equations <br>

            Systems of linear equations can be modelled numerically, graphically or algebraically. <br>
            The solution to a linear system is a pair of values that occurs in each table of values, an intersection point of the lines on a graph, or an ordered pair that satisfies each equation. <br>
            One way to solve a system of linear equations is to graph the lines and identify the point of intersection on the graph. <br>
            <br>
            A solution to a system of linear equations can be verified using several methods: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Substitute the value of each variable and evaluate the equations.
                <li>Create a graph and identify the point of intersection.

            When modelling word problems, assign variables that are meaningful to the context of the problem. <br>
            To assist in visualizing or organizing a word problem, you can use a diagram and /or a table of values. <br>
            <br>
    
            If a situation involves quantities that change at constant rates, you can represent it using a system of linear equations. <br>
            <br>
            If you know the initial values and rates, you can write the equations directly in slope-intercept form because the intial value is the y-intercept and the rate is the slope.  Otherwise, you can determine the rate of change using start and end values. <br>

            A system of linear equations can have one solution, no solution or an infinite number of solutions.
            Before solving, you can predict the number of solutions for a linear system by comparing the slopes and y-intercepts.
    
            For some linear systems, reducing the equations to lowest terms and comparing the coefficients of the x-terms, y-terms, and constants may help you predict the number of solutions.

            Elimination – look for the same coefficient in each equation <br>
            <br>
            Graphing – no coefficients of one or same coefficient in each.  Must be rearranged to y= <br>
    
            Solve by <br>
            Elimination when you have two coefficients the same. (2x, 2x) <br>
            Substitution when you have a coefficient of one. (Y or X) <br>
            Graphing if the equations have y isolate (y=... ) <br>
    
            Systems of linear equations can be solved <br>
                Graphically <br>
                Algebraically by substitution or by elimination <br>
            It may be better to use a graphical approach to solve linear equations when you wish to see how the two variables relate, such as for cost analysis and speed problems. <br>
             <br>
            It may be better to use an algebraic approach to solve linear equations when <br>
            You need only the solution (intersection point). <br>
            It is unclear where to locate the solution on a coordinate plane. <br>
